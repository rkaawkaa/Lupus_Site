        What exactly is fatigue?
      </h3>

      <p class="faq-text">
        Fatigue can be described as a subjective unpleasant sensation of exhaustion with physical and mental components, which interferes with individuals’ ability to function at their normal capacity. It is a complex, multidimensional and poorly understood concept.
Fatigue is a universal symptom experienced by nearly everyone in the general population, but the experience of fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus seems to differ from ‘everyday tiredness’, as being more frequent, unpredictable and typically unresolved by rest.

      <p class="faq-text">
        Lupus patients describe fatigue as one of the most common and bothersome symptom of the disease. It is reported by 67% to 90% of patients, and is often severe in intensity (one third of patients).

      <p class="faq-text">
        Fatigue may impair several key aspects of the quality of life, with repercussions on both physical and mental health. 
In systemic lupus erythematosus, fatigue has a negative impact on emotions, cognition, work, activities of daily living, leisure activities, social activities and family activities. 
Notably, it can be a cause of stress due to being unable to accomplish certain tasks.

        What are the predictors of fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus ?
      </h3>
      <div class="faq-text">
        <p>Fatigue is a highly multifactorial manifestation, caused by a complex interplay between disease itself, psychosocial, behavioral and personal factors.
          Here are the most important factors that have been described as fatigue determinants in systemic lupus erythematosus (a * means that its association with fatigue remains controversial):<br> 
          </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Depression and anxiety</li>
          <li>Stress</li>
          <li>Sleep disorder</li>
          <li>Disease activity, especially if associated with neurological impairment orpainful manifestations</li>
          <li>Pain</li>
          <li>Organ damage, such as renal or cardiologic failure
          </li>
          <li>Reduced level of physical activity
          </li>
          <li>Smoking</li>        
          <li>Obesity</li>        
          <li>Anemia</li>        
          <li>Adrenal failure</li>        
          <li>Vitamin D insufficiency</li>        
          <li>Sociodemographic features (low annual income, difficulties in accessing health care...)</li>        
          <li>Glucocorticoid use (BUT you should NEVER stop it or decrease it without your doctor's approval)</li> 
          <p><br>Here are some other common non-lupus related causes of fatigue:<br></p>
          <li>Pregnancy</li>      
          <li>Metabolic disorder (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, panhypopituitarism…)

        How can I assess my fatigue level in systemic lupus erythematosus ?
      </h3>
      <p class="faq-text">
        Because fatigue is a subjective symptom, the best way to assess fatigue is to let YOU evaluate it, with the use of validated Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs).<br> 
The most commonly used ones are FACIT-F - which you completed in the LEAF survey - or the FSS (Fatigue Severity Scale) for the intensity of your fatigue, and the MFI (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory) - which you also completed in the LEAF survey - for the characteristics of your fatigue.<br>
You can use these scores multiple times, for a follow up of your fatigue intensity and characteristics over time.

      </h3>
      <p class="faq-text">
        At this time, there is no validated recommendation for the management of fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus. <br>
Since fatigue may be influenced by a variety of factors, the management of fatigue should rely upon a personalized approach, using pharmacological treatments and/or non pharmacological interventions. <br>
Obvioulsy, management of fatigue predictors is important.

      </h3>
      <p class="faq-text">
        If your lupus is active,  lupus treatments may have beneficial effects on your fatigue.<br>
Vitamin D supplementation may help reducing fatigue, if you have vitamin D insufficiency.<br>
Other pharmacological treatments, such as analgesics or antidepressants, may be useful, according to the fatigue predictors you have.

      <div class="faq-text">
        <p>Physical activity is one of the most efficient intervention to improve fatigue – but it also leads to less pain interference, better physical function, cardiovascular risk reduction, bone strength amelioration, and even positive impact on the mood. Importantly, it is safe and well-tolerated for lupus patients. <br>Here are some other interventions that have proven their efficacity on reducing fatigue : 
        <ul>
          <li>Psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, psychoeducation, relaxation…
          </li>
          <li>Pain management : acupuncture, relaxation…
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Getting better sleep habits, quitting smoking, or anxiety/stress/depression management can also diminish fatigue.

        What is pain caused by? 
      </h3>
      <div class="faq-text">
        <p>Pain is usually caused by a <b>specific injury or a medical condition</b>, leading to some <b>tissue lesions.</b> <br>
          Patients feel pain when specific receptors called nociceptors detect tissue damage and transmit the information along the nerves and the spinal cord to the brain, that converts the signal into pain perception, thoughts, and emotions. <br>
          Sometimes, the <b>nervous system</b> (nerves, brain…) <b>itself is damaged and dysfunctional</b>, leading to amplification of pain perception, or pain signals without actual tissue lesion.  <br>
          In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, the inflammation associated with the disease activity is the most common cause of pain.

        Are there different kinds of pain?
      </h3>
      <div class="faq-text">
        <p>Pain can be classified into 3 major types of pain, depending on the physiopathological pathway leading to the pain perception:
          </p>
          <br>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Nociceptive pain</b> is the most common type of pain. It is caused by <b>tissue damage</b>, resulting from an<b> injury</b> or an<b> inflammation.</b> The pain is usually well localized, with aching or throbbing quality. 
          </li>
          <li>Neuropathic pain develops when <b>the nervous system (nerves, brain…) is damaged or dysfunctional.</b>  The pain is typically chronic and described as burning, numbness or electric shocks. Many different conditions and diseases cause neuropathic pain, including nerve compression, diabetes, cancer, stroke, post-herpetic neuralgia…
          </li>
          <li><b>Central sensitization</b> results from an <b>altered central perception of the pain signal</b>, without any tissue or neurologic lesion. This kind of pain is chronic and often associated with psychological symptoms. </li>
        </ul>

        What about pain in systemic lupus erythematosus ?
      </h3>
      <div class="faq-text">
        <p>Pain is one of the most frequent and bothersome symptom in systemic lupus. <br><br>
          In patients with systemic lupus, pain often results from the <b>inflammation associated with the disease activity</b>: arthralgia, myalgia, chest pain due to pericarditis or pleurisy, oral ulcers… <br><br>
          <b>Fibromyalgia</b> is another frequent cause of pain in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, as it affects 6.2% to 30% of systemic lupus patients. Fibromyalgia is a disorder in which the brain amplifies the way it processes painful signals. It is characterized by<b> chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain</b>, often associated with fatigue and mood issues. <br><br>
          Your pain may also result from non-lupus related causes, such as non-traumatic facture, sprain, osteoarthritis, nerve compression, or any other condition.

        What are the consequences of chronic pain ?
      </h3>
      <div class="faq-text">
        <p>Chronic pain lasts for over 3 months, and sometimes continues long after you recover from an injury or an illness. <br> <br>
          It often <b>interferes with the quality of life</b> and has a lot of <b>psychological, cognitive, and social consequences</b>, such as fatigue, sleep disorders, concentration difficulties, or work issues. Complications of chronic pain also include anxiety, depression, or substance abuse disorders.
